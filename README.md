## Motivation

I love listening to radio while I work. There are tens of tousands of cool internet radio stations available, however I find it hard to "find" new stations by using filters and genres. As of now, this little app takes away all the filtering and just presents me with new radio stations every time I use it.

While I hacked on this App, I discovered so many cool and new stations, which makes it even more enjoyable. I hope you enjoy it too.

## Features

- Uses radio-browser.info catalog
- Presets various selection of stations (random, top, trending, genres)
- Save favourite stations
- Sends a click count to radio-browser.info on station click
- Sends a vote count to radio-browser.info when you star a station
- DBus integration to pause/resume playing and show station info in Wingpanel

## Upcoming

- More selection screens (Popular networks, Country-specific)
- More filter options (country)
- Community-listening: see what other users are listening to right now
- Other ideas? Create an issue!

## Environment Variables

* `TUNER_API` - a `:` separated list of API servers to read from, e.g.

work from people all over the world producing free software, this project would
not have been possible.
